## Introduction
I am a student, currently attending the Deep Dive Coding Java + Android Bootcamp. I am a quick learner looking to challenge myself, entering an always-changing field where I know I can always learn something new. After this bootcamp, my plan is to look for employment in Java enterprise-level development.
